## Usage

This section highlights how to get started with the project and provides basic examples to help new contributors. Your contributions to enhance these features are always welcome!

### Real-Time Gameplay

Enable real-time gameplay using WebSocket for board state synchronization.

```javascript
// Listening for board state updates from the server
socket.on("boardState", (fen) => {
  console.log("Received board state:", fen);
  chess.load(fen); // Load the board state into the Chess.js instance
  renderBoard();   // Render the updated board on the frontend
});
```

### Dynamic Chart for Move Analysis

Visualize player performance or game data dynamically using Chart.js.

```javascript
// Creating a line chart for player performance analysis
const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
const myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'line',
  data: {
    labels: ['Move 1', 'Move 2', 'Move 3'],
    datasets: [{
      label: 'Player Performance',
      data: [10, 20, 30],
      borderColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
      borderWidth: 2
    }]
  },
});
```

### Template Rendering with EJS

Render server-side templates dynamically with EJS for efficient content updates.

```html
<div class="chess-board">
  <% for (let row of board) { %>
    <div class="row">
      <% for (let square of row) { %>
        <div class="square"><%= square %></div>
      <% } %>
    </div>
  <% } %>
</div>
```
